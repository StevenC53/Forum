## Creativity and Interface
**1: Progressing**
>The app is styled and has an interface of value to the end user: it is not just a nav bar and an index page

## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
>Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

## Deployment and Functionality

## Planning / Process / Submission
**1: Progressing**
>App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application

Hey, great job Steven!  Logic and functionality are all sound.  I'd say biggest improvements that could be made are:  Adding validations, adding flash messages for when a form is submitted properly, and **styling**.  Styling and CSS isn't everyone's cup or tea, but you have a well functioning page and a little CSS magic could make it feel and look a lot more modern.
